What's this?
------------
This plugin automatically sends an email to workers if they have received new notifications.  It sends digests, so if you receive 100 new assignments you'll only receive a single email about them.

Installation

* Change directory to **/cerb6/storage/plugins/**
* `git clone git://github.com/cerb-plugins/wgm.notifications.emailer.git`
* In your helpdesk, enable the plugin from **Setup->Features & Plugins**.
