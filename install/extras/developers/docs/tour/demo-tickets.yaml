      Hi Alessio,
      
      Cerb helps you build and automate workflows; it improves team collaboration; and it can replace several other apps and services to reduce your costs.
      
      Your team only needs a web browser to use it, and they have the freedom to work from anywhere.
      
      You have the flexibility to run Cerb on your own servers or as a fully managed service in the cloud.

      > What kinds of things can Cerb automate on a typical team?
      
      Hi Inès,
      
      Some of the most common workflows that people automate with Cerb are:
      
      * Routing new requests to the right groups and people
      
      * Notifying the right people about new activity (new tickets, replies, leads)
      
      * Generating activity and performance reports at regular intervals
      
      * Integrating with other apps and services
      
      * On-boarding new clients
      
      * Retrieving data from various back-end systems
      
      You can use bots in Cerb to automate nearly anything a human worker can do.

      > What are seats exactly -- total users, max logged in users?
      
      Hi Sarah,
      
      Seats determine the maximum number of workers who can use Cerb at the same time.
      
      For example, a team of 30 workers who are evenly split into three, non-overlapping shifts (morning, day, night) would only require 10 seats. That’s the highest number of workers who would ever be logged in at the same time.
      
      You aren’t paying per worker account, so there isn’t a penalty for inviting everyone to participate: full-time staff, part-time contributors, busy executives, interns, temps, contractors, partners, and volunteers.

      Hi Jennifer,
      
      Cerb Cloud is a fully managed service. We automatically handle upgrades, backups, security, scaling, maintenance, monitoring, etc. The service automatically scales up and down as your workload changes. We also provide high volume email servers that are tuned for deliverability. This allows your team to focus on what you do best.
      
      A self-hosted license permits you to run Cerb on your own servers. You have full control, but you're also responsible for all administration. This may be required for regulatory compliance (e.g. HIPAA).
      
      Cerb offers the same features in both deployment options.

      Cerb warns a worker if they start replying to a ticket that someone else is already responding to. You'll also see a worker's photo in ticket lists when they're working on it.
      
      It's also a good idea for workers to assign tickets to themselves while they're replying.

      Hi Kyan!
      
      In Cerb, permissions are granted to workers using roles. Roles may permit all privileges, no privileges, or a specific itemized list.
      
      Each role has a membership, as well as editors and readers for role-owned records.
      
      Workers may have multiple roles. A particular privilege is granted to a worker if _any_ of their roles permit it.
      
      Administrations have no restrictions on their privileges.

      With Cerb Cloud we handle all of this for you.

      Hi Patricia,
      
      Each group or bucket may have its own signature. Since you can move a ticket around during a reply, we include a `#signature` placeholder that will be replaced with your full signature.
      
      The #signature placeholder makes it much easier for bots to locate the signature when they need to append something to outgoing mail (e.g. a personalized sales tagline, or disclaimer text).
      
      The placeholder also makes it easier for you to write concise replies from any device (including smartphones). You don't have to waste limited screen space looking at your own signature over and over.
      
      You can preview the final signature from the reply form's toolbar.

      1. If you want each worker to have a workspace they can modify as needed, then they should be the owner of a new page. You'll end up with a page for each worker.
      
      2. If you want each worker to see their own content in a consistent way, you can use a single role-owned page using "current worker" placeholders. This will change the content based on who is viewing the page.

      Hi Hui,
      
      Cerb uses Bayesian statistical analysis to assign a spam score to the first message of each new ticket. This identifies words and phrases that are suspicious.
      
      The spam score may be used by bots to quarantine spam, but by default no actions are taken against suspected spam.
      
      You may also create mail filtering rules based on other solutions like SpamAssassin.

      Hi Ethan,
      
      Search queries are a text-based language for filtering records. They are efficient, expressive, and automation-friendly.
      
      Using queries, search functionality is consistent between bots, worklists, data queries, and API requests.
      
      As text, queries can be built dynamically using bot scripting syntax. They also simplify many complex operations that would otherwise be tedious (or impossible) to automate or represent with web-based forms.

      Bots in Cerb can be built entirely within your web browser. They listen for events (e.g. new email message), qualify using conditions (e.g. date/time, sender), and run actions (e.g. automatically reply, update a record's fields).

      Hi Lisa,
      
      Cerb is very flexible about how you enter dates. The most common formats are:
      
      * Absolute: "Jan 9 2020 00:00", "26-May-2022 2pm"
      
      * Relative: "next Friday noon", "-3 days", "first day of this month"
      
      * Unix timestamp (seconds elapsed since Jan 1 1970 UTC): 1550080259

      Most browsers already have a shortcut for opening new tabs by holding Command/Control when left-clicking a link.
      
      Have you tried explore mode in Cerb? This makes it easy to navigate through records in a worklist, and you can always return to the list itself.

      We've provided a lot of examples in the default reports page:
      
      1. Click the down arrow in your pages menu at the top.
      
      2. Click the (+) icon in the right of the blue bar above the worklist.

      These textual queries are very simple to automate in bot behaviors, dashboard widgets, or the API.

      Hi Yaseen,
      
      You can use a bot behavior to check if a new message has a parent ticket that is closed. If so, remove the 'In-Reply-To:' and 'References:' headers.
      
      This will cause the new message to open a new ticket.

      Every bot behavior can use the "Execute HTTP request" action.
      
      Enter your webhook URL and include any parameters you need to send for the event.

      Hi Isabella,
      
      All bot behaviors support the "Execute HTTP request" action. You can use connected services to securely authorize these requests (e.g. HTTP Basic, tokens, OAuth).
      
      This allows you to access any endpoint in any API from a bot behavior in Cerb.

      Hi Teun,
      
      Every bot behavior has access to the "simulator", which lets you pick a target record and shows you what the outcome of the behavior would be.
      
      You can disable a behavior until you're ready for it to go live.

      Hi Mathias,
      
      You can enable the "Time Tracking" plugin in Cerb from Setup->Plugins->Library.
      
      Once enabled, a timer icon will appear at the top of every record profile. When clicked, it will open a stopwatch to keep track of time spent.
      
      The resulting time tracking entry will automatically be linked to the current record.

      Hi Bradley,
      
      A chat bot’s primary goal is to determine a human’s "intent" (what they want to accomplish) from their utterances in natural language, and then to fulfill those requests in a helpful way.
      
      There are a number of ways to detect a user's intent.
      
      One of the simpler options is the "classifiers" feature.
      
      You can also use a more advanced service like Amazon Lex within your Cerb bot.

      For example, you can use the API from other applications and services to create tickets, search records, monitor notifications, manage tasks, and interact with bots.

      This sounds like exactly what kanban-style project boards are designed to help with.
      
      With kanban, each project has a board, and each unit of work (or task) in that project is represented by a card. Cards are organized into columns on the board based on their stage of completion. Typically, cards move from left to right through the columns of the process.

      There is a custom field type for "Latitude/Longitude". You can go to Search->Custom Fields and add a new "Coordinates" field of that type to organization records.
      
      When you edit organizations you can then set their GPS coordinates.
      
      You can retrieve coordinates for any record using data queries to plot them on map widgets.
