Hi Fran√ßois,

MySQL replication is useful for automated fail-over and having a hot standby server to minimize disaster recovery times, but it's not absolutely required for backups.  The cost of redundant hardware is usually weighed against your budget and your availability requirements.

However, we absolute recommend using a RAID on the database server.

With a database backup of a few GB in SQL format, it should only take a couple minutes to import and rebuild your indexes.

One upside of replication is that you can use the replicas for distributions reads (e.g. searches) to reduce the load on the master.

As for backups in general, see:
