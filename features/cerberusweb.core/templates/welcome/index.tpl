	You only need to understand a few concepts to get started:
	<ul style="list-style:square;">
		<li><p>A <b>ticket</b> is a specific email conversation and all of its related messages and content. Every ticket has a unique, random identifier (e.g. ABC-12345-678) for quick reference by anyone involved.</p></li>
		<li><p>The people on the originating end of tickets are <b>participants</b>. There can be multiple participants on a single ticket.</p></li>
		<li><p>The people on the answering end of tickets are <b>workers</b>.</p></li>
		<li><p>A <b>watcher</b> is a worker who is notified about all new activity on a record. For example, a supervisor may be a watcher on all new tickets to monitor the quality of the messages that workers are writing back to recipients.</p></li>
		<li><p>Several workers who share responsibility for the same kinds of tickets can form a <b>group</b>. Common groups are: Sales, Support, Development, Billing, and Corporate. Groups can be based on anything.</p></li>
		<li><p>A <b>bucket</b> is a container for storing similar tickets within a group. Common buckets are: Leads, Receipts, Newsletters, Refunds, and Spam.</p></li>
		<li><p>Each worker in a group is called a <b>member</b>. A member with the authority to administer the group is called a <b>manager</b>. Groups can have any number of managers.</p></li>
		<li><p>Every group has an <b>inbox</b> bucket where new tickets are delivered by default. These tickets are then organized into other buckets by workers or bots.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Automations</b> are virtual workers who perform actions in response to <b>events</b>. They can be built completely within the browser.</p></li>
