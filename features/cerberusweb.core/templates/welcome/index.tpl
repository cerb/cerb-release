	<legend>The Basics in 60 Seconds</legend>
	
	You only need to understand a few concepts to get started:
	<ul style="list-style:square;">
		<li><p>A <b>ticket</b> is a specific email conversation and all of its related messages and content.  Every ticket has a unique identifier so they can be quickly referenced by anyone involved.</p></li>
		<li><p>The people on the originating end of tickets are called <b>recipients</b>.  There can be multiple recipients on a single ticket.</p></li>
		<li><p>The people on the answering end of tickets are called <b>workers</b>.</p></li>
		<li><p>A <b>watcher</b> is a worker who is notified about all new activity on a record.  For example, a supervisor may be a watcher on all new tickets to monitor the quality of the messages that workers are writing back to recipients.</p></li>
		<li><p>Several workers who share responsibility for the same kinds of tickets can form a <b>group</b>.  Common groups are: Sales, Support, Development, Billing, and Corporate.  Groups can be based on anything.</p></li>
		<li><p>A <b>bucket</b> is a container for storing similar tickets within a group.  Common buckets are: Leads, Receipts, Newsletters, Refunds, and Spam.</p></li>
		<li><p>Each worker in a group is called a <b>member</b>.  A member with the authority to administer the group is called a <b>manager</b>.  Groups can have any number of managers.</p></li>
		<li><p>Every group has an <b>inbox</b> bucket where new tickets are delivered by default.  These tickets are then organized into other buckets by workers or bots.</p></li>
		<li><p><b>Bots</b> are software agents that are capable of performing most of the same actions as workers.  They provide an efficient way to automate common workflows.  Any number of bots can be managed by workers, groups, or roles, and their behaviors can be completely built within the browser -- even by workers with little or no computer programming experience.</p></li>
