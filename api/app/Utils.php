/*
 * IMPORTANT LICENSING NOTE from your friends at Cerb
 *
 * Sure, it would be really easy to just cheat and edit this file to use
 * Cerb without paying for a license.  We trust you anyway.
 *
 * It takes a significant amount of time and money to develop, maintain,
 * and support high-quality enterprise software with a dedicated team.
 * For Cerb's entire history we've avoided taking money from outside
 * investors, and instead we've relied on actual sales from satisfied
 * customers to keep the project running.
 *
 * We've never believed in hiding our source code out of paranoia over not
 * getting paid.  We want you to have the full source code and be able to
 * make the tweaks your organization requires to get more done -- despite
 * having less of everything than you might need (time, people, money,
 * energy).  We shouldn't be your bottleneck.
 *
 * As a legitimate license owner, your feedback will help steer the project.
 * We'll also prioritize your issues, and work closely with you to make sure
 * your teams' needs are being met.
 *
 * - Jeff Standen and Dan Hildebrandt
 *	 Founders at Webgroup Media LLC; Developers of Cerb
